# UD Dashboard Configuration Guide

## Step 1: Open the Domain Manage Page

Select a domain you want to set as your reverse record and navigate to its `Manage` page. The domain you choose is what applications that integrate with Unstoppable Domains will display for your address.

## Step 2: Set the Reverse Record

Navigate to the `Reverse Resolution` tab on the manage page sidebar (left side of the screen) and click the `Start Record Update` button to add a reverse record to your domain.

## Step 3: Sign the Transaction

Click the `Sign` button to sign a transaction confirming you own the address you're setting the reverse record.

After signing the transaction, you can view its details on the blockchain explorer, like so:

Now, applications that have integrated Reverse Resolution will be able to show the reverse record for your domains instead of your wallet address.
