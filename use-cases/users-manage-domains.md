# Allow Unstoppable Domain Management in Your App

This page outlines the use case for allowing your users to manage their existing UD domains using your own decentralized application.

## How does it work?

You can configure your application to edit domain metadata manually with a direct connection to the appropriate blockchain. We strongly recommend prior experience with blockchain development before starting this type of integration, so please familiarize yourself with [CNS Smart Contracts](/developer-toolkit/reference/smart-contracts/cns-smart-contracts.md) or [UNS Smart Contracts](/developer-toolkit/reference/smart-contracts/uns-smart-contracts.md).

## Are there working integrations for this feature?

Popular open-source crypto wallet, [MyEtherWallet](https://www.myetherwallet.com/), has implemented domain management and can also be used as a reference for implementation: [MyEtherWallet Code Reference](https://github.com/MyEtherWallet/MyEtherWallet/tree/main/src/dapps/unstoppable-domains-dapp).

You can find additional working integrations on UD's Applications List, filtered by the [Domain Management feature](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps?filters=7).

## How do I get started?

See the guides on [Managing Domain Ownership](/manage-domains/index.md), [Managing Domain Records](/manage-domains/managing-domain-records.md), [Delegating Transactions](/manage-domains/delegating-transactions.md) and [Delegating Domain Management](/manage-domains/delegating-domain-management.md) to get started with the domain management integration.
