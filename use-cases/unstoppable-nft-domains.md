## What are Unstoppable Domains?

Unstoppable Domains are NFTs, and they are decentralized. What sets an Unstoppable Domains NFT apart from traditional domain names (like .com) is that NFT domains are stored by their owners in their wallets like cryptocurrency, and no third party can change or remove them. This makes them, in a word, **unstoppable**.

Also, there are no renewal fees for Unstoppable Domains names, so once you own the domain, you own it for life.

## What makes NFT domains decentralized?

Once a user mints a domain to a wallet, they have absolute control over that domain. NFT Domains can be transferred, updated, and linked to other services without any involvement from Unstoppable Domains. Unstoppable Domains cannot deactivate, change, or transfer a domain's records without a user's permission.

## How can I learn more?

To learn more about how Unstoppable Domains work under the hood, see the [CNS Architecture](../getting-started/domain-registry-essentials/cns-architecture-overview.md) and [CNS Smart Contracts](../developer-toolkit/smart-contracts/cns-smart-contracts.md) or [UNS Architecture](../getting-started/domain-registry-essentials/uns-architecture-overview.md) along with [UNS Smart Contracts](../developer-toolkit/smart-contracts/uns-smart-contracts.md).
