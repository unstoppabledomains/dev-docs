## What are Unstoppable Domains?

Unstoppable Domains are NFTs, and they are decentralized. What sets Unstoppable Domains apart from traditional domain names (like .com) is that they are stored by their owners in their wallets like cryptocurrency, and no third party can change or remove them. This makes them, in a word, **unstoppable**.

Also, there are no renewal fees for Unstoppable Domains names, so once you own the domain, you own it for life.

## What makes Web3 domains decentralized?

Once users mint a domain to a wallet, they have absolute control over that domain. Web3 domains can be transferred, updated, and linked to other services without involvement from Unstoppable Domains. Unstoppable Domains cannot deactivate, change, or transfer a domain's records without a user's permission.

## How can I learn more?

To learn more about how Unstoppable Domains work under the hood, see the [CNS Architecture](/getting-started/domain-registry-essentials/cns-architecture-overview.md) and [CNS Smart Contracts](/smart-contracts/contract-reference/cns-smart-contracts.md) or [UNS Architecture](/getting-started/domain-registry-essentials/uns-architecture-overview.md) along with [UNS Smart Contracts](/smart-contracts/contract-reference/uns-smart-contracts.md).
