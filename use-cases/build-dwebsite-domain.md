## How does it work? 

After purchasing a domain from UD, you can build your IPFS website using a template or custom design. Then, you will attach the IPFS website to your Unstoppable Domain via the IPFS hash -- this makes your website decentralized and unstoppable!

## How do I get started?

If you are new to IPFS and decentralized websites (d-web), we recommend that you start with the [IPFS Overview](/d-websites/index.md) and [Building a Website](/d-websites/build-website.md) pages. See the guide on [Resolving a D-Website in a Browser](/d-websites/resolving-dwebsites-in-a-browser.md) to view your d-website after connecting it to your domain.
