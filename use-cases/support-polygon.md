This page outlines the use case for supporting Unstoppable Domains on Polygon L2 Network.

## How does it work?

Unstoppable Domains uses [Polygon](https://polygon.technology/) as our Layer 2 (L2) scaling solution. This allows us to make our NFT domains free to mint and manage on L2, and UD customers will no longer have to pay minting fees, renewal fees, or [gas fees](https://youtu.be/h3rP3Ptvka4).

As part of this integration, new and existing members will be able to mint and manage their domains for free on Polygon and existing members will be able to move their domains from Zilliqa and Ethereum to Polygon as well if they so choose.

## How do I get started?

See the [Polygon High Level Overview](../polygon/index.md) for discussion of the benefits and considerations for Polygon L2. We have also outlined the steps needed to migrate Unstoppable domains to Polygon L2 for [CNS Layer 1 to UNS Layer 2](../polygon/cns1-to-uns2.md) and [UNS Layer 1 to UNS Layer 2](../polygon/uns1-to-uns2.md).
