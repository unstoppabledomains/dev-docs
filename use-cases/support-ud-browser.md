# Support Unstoppable Domains in Your Web Browser

This page outlines the use case for supporting Unstoppable Domains in my web browser, allowing users of your browser to create and view decentralized websites.

## How does it work?

The website is decentralized by being created on the Ethereum blockchain, and the domain is stored in a userâ€™s wallet, just like a cryptocurrency.

## Who controls the content?

Individuals control their content and identity with a decentralized website. No one can delete content (such as blogs, podcasts, artwork, or social media) or move it around other than the domain owner.

## Are there working integrations for this feature?
