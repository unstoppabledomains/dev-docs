## Where can I find a list of UD integrations?

You can find registered apps on the Unstoppable Domains [Homepage](https://unstoppabledomains.com) and [Applications](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps) page. This free advertising puts your app in front of tens of thousands of potential customers per day.

## How do I register my application with UD?

We'd love to advertise and promote your UD integration! Once your app has a working Unstoppable Domains integration, [register it here](https://unstoppabledomains.com/app-submission).

## Are there additional incentives to registering my application on the UD homepage?

Of course! Every week we select a newly-integrated app to feature in the Unstoppable Domains newsletter. This newsletter is delivered to ~100,000 crypto fanatics — all of whom could become new customers to grow your business.
