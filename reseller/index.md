To avoid missing the email about your reseller application status, please update your email settings to approve messages from [notifications@unstoppabledomains.com](mailto:notifications@unstoppabledomains.com), so it doesn’t end up in your spam folder.
:::

## Step 3: Configure Payment Information

- The Reseller API must be configured with one or more payment options before users can begin purchasing domains. Please follow the instructions in the **[Reseller Integration Pathways Guide](reseller-integration-guides/reseller-pathways.md)** to integrate one or more payment methods for your reseller account.
