# Reseller Integration Guides

UD's Reseller API is a versatile feature with several integration pathways available for developers. This page reviews the integration guides and overall features for each installation option.

:::warning Important
Reseller API Integrations will only work on **Polygon L2 network**. See the [Polygon Developer Integration Guide](../../polygon/polygon-migration-guide.md) to get started.
:::

## Step 1: Register As a Reseller

Before beginning the integration process for Unstoppable's Reseller feature, you must register as a reseller and obtain reseller credentials. Please see the [**Register as a Reseller Guide**](../index.md) for more details.

## Step 2: Locate Your Reseller ID

To integrate free or paid domain minting (via Stripe, Coinbase, Redirect URL, etc.) for your customers, you must know your resellerID. This information can be found in your [UD Reseller Dashboard](https://unstoppabledomains.com/resellers).
