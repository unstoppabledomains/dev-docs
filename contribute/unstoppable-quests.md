# UD Developer Quests 📚

## Context 

> *"If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together."*

We're up to our ears in exciting work at Unstoppable Domains, and even then, there are millions of things that never get checked off our to-do list. We know we can't do it alone and that's why we created "Quest" for developers like yourself can complete and continue building towards our vision of the [Decentralized Web](https://unstoppabledomains.com/blog/the-growth-of-the-internet-and-the-web).

This is our first iteration of Quests, and we will continue improving it over time. Right now, we have a list of Quests — which will evolve overtime as quests are completed and more continue to get added based on various needs. The goal is to foster innovative solutions to tricky problems that we're tackling.
