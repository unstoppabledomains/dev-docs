# Content Generation ✍️

**For non-technical community members**, we've created Quests for Content Generation! There are two types of content gen Quests: (1) tutorials, and (2) impression mining.

Ask on our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/unstoppableweb) on Twitter, if you're interested.

## Instructions for Tutorials

We're offering **$100 in domain credits** for any tutorial for Unstoppable Domains.

- How to connect a d-website to an Unstoppable domain
- How to set up a d-blog with your domain
- How to set up an NFT gallery with your domain
- If you have another example, we'd love to include it!

If submitted, we'll be uploading the content to our YouTube channel (12K+ subscribers) — crediting you for the work!

## Instructions for Impression Mining

Impression mining allows anyone to become a micro-influencer for Unstoppable Domains! We're offering **$1 in domain credits per 10 impressions on Twitter**.

Participants will simply snap a screenshot of their impression counts and submit to the intake form for a monthly payment in domain credits. Judging submissions is at the sole discretion of Unstoppable Domains. The reviewers reserve the right to cap a payment or deem an account ineligible for current or future rewards.

**Example**
`ddwchen.crypto` brings receipts from 11 tweets about Unstoppable Domain or its products from July 2021 totaling 240k impressions; she is rewarded with $2.4k worth of domain credits.

### Limitations

**The program will *not* tolerate/reward:**

- Spamming followers
- Paid impressions
- General trickery
- Inauthentic content
- Misleading content
- Saturation of themes

### Other Considerations

- Unless you have built up an audience beforehand, consistent success with this program will not generally come swiftly
- In general, content should aim to be:
    - Shareable
    - Aesthetically pleasing
    - Distribution-minded
    - Uniquely Insightful (Use-Case, how-to, history, stat/metric, story, testimonial, infographic, video)
    - NOT about speculation, price, nor the selling of domains
