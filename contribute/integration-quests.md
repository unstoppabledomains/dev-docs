# Integration Quests 🔌

Domains need integrations in order to actually be used by customers. At Unstoppable, we work alongside companies and apps in order to offer domain resolution natively in the app. However, we can't get to them all — so we're asking for the community's help in integrating Unstoppable Domains into other applications

Integration quests will cover open-source crypto wallets (for payments), browsers (for website resolution), and other apps. 

## Instructions

1. Initiate a pull request from the open-source app's GitHub repo to modify the source code *(links provided in the table below).*
2. Modify the source code to integrate with the Unstoppable resolution libraries: 
    * [Resolution](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution)
    * [Resolution-Java](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-java)
    * [Resolution-Swift](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-swift)
    * [Resolution-Go](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-go)
3. Documentation for resolution libraries is available here
    * For wallets: [Resolution Libraries Overview](../developer-toolkit/resolution-libraries/libraries-overview.md)
    * For browsers: [Resolving Domains in a Web Applications](../developer-toolkit/resolve-domains-in-web-applications.md)
4. Inform us before you make the commit. We will setup a code review and confirm that everything is working correctly. After the code review, you can proceed with the commit to the repo.
5. The quest is completed when the PR is merged into the git repository!
