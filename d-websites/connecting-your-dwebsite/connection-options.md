## Configuring Your D-Website

Hosting a d-website on IPFS is slightly different from hosting it on a centralized web server, and you will need to ensure that your website is properly configured for the IPFS network. Important rules to follow:

* All of the content for your website must be contained in one build folder, with an index.html file.
* All links within your files should be relative links.

These rules apply if you are building and uploading your own customized website using connection [Option 2 ](./#option-2-upload-your-own-website-files-to-our-ipfs-uploader)or [Option 3](./#option-3-build-a-customized-website-yourself-and-attach-your-ipfs-hash-to-your-domain) below.

## Connecting Your Site to Your Domain

UD provides three options for connecting your decentralized website to your domain:

1. Select an UD website template to customize and deploy directly to IPFS
2. Upload your own website files to our IPFS uploader (limited to 20MB per domain)
3. Build a customized website yourself and attach your IPFS hash to your domain

The following flow chart outlines the process for purchasing a domain and then connecting a decentralized website to your domain.
