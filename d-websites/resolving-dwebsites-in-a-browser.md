# Resolving D-Websites in a Browser

It will take some time for the IPFS website transaction to resolve on the blockchain after the transaction is signed with the userâ€™s wallet. After the domain records are updated, the decentralized website will resolve in certain browsers and browser extensions.

## Add a Custom DNS to Your Browser

:::info
These settings only allow your to resolve .crypto domains in your browser. To resolve .zil or other top level domains, you will either need the [browser extension](https://unstoppabledomains.com/extension) or the [Unstoppable Browser](https://unstoppabledomains.com/browser).

The following table provides the configuration options for different browsers in order to view Unstoppable d-websites.

Once you have configured your browser according to this section, you will be able to access .crypto Unstoppable domains in two different ways:

1. `http://domainname.crypto`. note that it is `http` and **not** `https`
2. `domainname.crypto/`, using a **forward slash** to override your browser's default search engine behavior.

:::info
If you have the Unstoppable extension in your browser you will need to disable it to switch to DNS over https (which retains the domain name in the browser).

## Resolve Using a Gateway URL

You can also resolve a decentralized website using a gateway URL, such as the ones provided by [Blockscan](http://blockscan.com) or [Pinata](https://docs.pinata.cloud/gateways/dedicated-gateways).

IPFS gateways provide workarounds for applications that do not yet support IPFS natively, which allows those browsers and tools to access IPFS content. See the resource guide on [IPFS Gateways](https://docs.ipfs.io/concepts/ipfs-gateway/#overview) for more information.

## **Redirect to a Traditional DNS Record with an Unstoppable Domain**

In order to set up a redirection to a traditional domain, you will need to do a redirection via `index.html` on your NFT domain so visitors are sent to a traditional domain.

1. On your computer, open a text editor (for example: Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Mac) and paste the following code into an empty file.

   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
     <head>
       <title>HTML Meta Tag</title>
       <meta http-equiv="refresh" content="1; url = YOUR WEBSITE URL HERE" />
     </head>
     <body>
       <p>YOUR WEBSITE DESCRIPTION HERE</p>
     </body>
   </html>
   ```

2. Replace `YOUR WEBSITE HERE` with your website URL and `YOUR WEBSITE DESCRIPTION HERE` with a short description of your website and save the file as `index.html` (**do not use any other name**).

3. Open `index.html` from your hard drive to see if everything is working before proceeding. Right-click the file and select "**Open with**" followed by your browser of choice.

3. Follow the instructions in [Upload Your Website to IPFS](upload-ipfs.md) and [Connect Your IPFS Site to Your Domain](connect-ipfs.md) to upload your redirect `index.html` to IPFS and attach it to your domain.
