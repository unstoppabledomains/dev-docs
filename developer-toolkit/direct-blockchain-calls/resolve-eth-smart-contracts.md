# Resolve Using Ethereum Smart Contracts

Resolving a domain is a process of retrieving a domain's records when the domain name and required record names are given. There are no limits to who can read domain records on the Registry side. Anyone with access to a mainnet Ethereum Node can resolve a domain.

This section describes resolving domain records by making calls to Ethereum smart contracts using the Ethereum JSON RPC. For developers who would prefer a more straightforward solution, it might be more convenient to use the [resolution libraries](../resolution-libraries/libraries-overview.md) maintained by Unstoppable Domains.

To resolve a domain, your software must have access to the Ethereum network. For more information, see [Configuring an ethereum network connection](#configuring-an-ethereum-network-connection).

## Retrieve Records with `ProxyReader`

The simplest way to resolve a domain with Ethereum JSON RPC is to make a read-only call to `ProxyReader` smart contract. `ProxyReader` provides an API that allows users to resolve domains making just one call by passing only keys of records and a domain namehash. Without `ProxyReader` it would require executing at least two calls: one to obtain a domain resolver address and another one to get the records themselves. With `ProxyReader` it all happens under the hood.

An example in JavaScript of getting two records (using the [ethers.js library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ethers)):

```javascript
const proxyReaderAddress = '0xfEe4D4F0aDFF8D84c12170306507554bC7045878';
// Partial ABI, just for the getMany function.
const proxyReaderAbi = [
  'function getMany(string[] calldata keys, uint256 tokenId) external view returns (string[] memory)',
];
const proxyReaderContract = new ethers.Contract(
  proxyReaderAddress,
  proxyReaderAbi,
  provider
);

const domain = 'brad.crypto';
const tokenId = namehash(domain);
const keys = ['crypto.ETH.address', 'crypto.BTC.address'];

const values = await proxyReaderContract.getMany(keys, tokenId);
console.log(values);
// [
//   '0x8aaD44321A86b170879d7A244c1e8d360c99DdA8',
//   'bc1q359khn0phg58xgezyqsuuaha28zkwx047c0c3y'
// ]
```

UNS code example:

```javascript
var address = '0x299974AeD8911bcbd2C61262605b89F591a53E83';
var abi = [
  {
    constant: true,
    inputs: [
      {
        internalType: 'string[]',
        name: 'keys',
        type: 'string[]',
      },
      {
        internalType: 'uint256',
        name: 'tokenId',
        type: 'uint256',
      },
    ],
    name: 'getData',
    outputs: [
      {
        internalType: 'address',
        name: 'resolver',
        type: 'address',
      },
      {
        internalType: 'address',
        name: 'owner',
        type: 'address',
      },
      {
        internalType: 'string[]',
        name: 'values',
        type: 'string[]',
      },
    ],
    payable: false,
    stateMutability: 'view',
    type: 'function',
  },
];
var provider = ethers.providers.getDefaultProvider('goerli');
var contract = new ethers.Contract(address, abi, provider);
async function fetchContractData(keys, tokenId) {
  return contract.getData(keys, tokenId);
}
const domain = 'udtestdev-test-btc-record.coin';
const tokenId = namehash(domain);
const interestedKeys = ['crypto.BTC.address', 'crypto.ETH.address'];
const data = await fetchContractData(interestedKeys, tokenId);
console.log({ resolver: data.resolver, owner: data.owner, values: data[2] });
/*
 * {
 *   owner: "0xe7474D07fD2FA286e7e0aa23cd107F8379085037"
 *   resolver: "0x7fb83000B8eD59D3eAD22f0D584Df3a85fBC0086"
 *   values: [ "bc1q359khn0phg58xgezyqsuuaha28zkwx047c0c3y", "0xe7474D07fD2FA286e7e0aa23cd107F8379085037" ]
 * }

[![Resolving domain records via proxyreader for CNS and UNS Registries](/images/domain-records-via-proxy-reader-smart-contract.png)](/images/domain-records-via-proxy-reader-smart-contract.png)

See the [Records Reference](../../getting-started/domain-registry-essentials/records-reference.md) for more information about the standardized records.

## Record Value Validation

For CNS, `Resolver` doesn't have built-in record value validation when it is updated. For UNS, `RecordStorage` doesnâ€™t have built in record value validation after an update.

This is for two reasons:

- Any validation would require additional gas to be paid
- Solidity is a special-purpose programming language that doesn't have built-in data validation tools like Regular Expressions

Any domain management application should perform record format validation before submitting a transaction. However, there is no guarantee that all management applications will do it correctly. For this reason, records should be validated when the domain is resolved too.

See the [Records Reference](../../getting-started/domain-registry-essentials/records-reference.md) for more information for the validator of each record.

## Configuring an Ethereum Network Connection

Domain resolution configuration at a low level requires 3 configuration parameters:

- Ethereum JSON RPC provider
- Ethereum CHAIN ID
- Registry Contract Address

Ethereum JSON RPC provider is an API implementing the Ethereum JSON RPC standard. Usually, it is given in a form of an HTTP API endpoint. However, other forms may exist if the Ethereum node is launched locally. Unstoppable Domains recommends the [Cloudflare Ethereum Gateway](https://developers.cloudflare.com/distributed-web/ethereum-gateway), an Ethereum node service provider. To learn more about providers, see [Nodes and client](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/) and [Nodes as a service](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/).

Ethereum CHAIN ID is an ID of the Ethereum network a node is connected to. Each RPC provider can only be connected to one network. There is only one production network with CHAIN ID equal to `1` and called `mainnet`. Other networks are only used for testing purposes. See [EIP-155](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-155) for more information. CHAIN ID of an Ethereum node can be determined by calling the [net version method](https://eth.wiki/json-rpc/API#net_version) on JSON RPC which should be used as a default when only JSON RPC provider is given.

There are two registry contract addresses, **Crypto Registry Contract Address** and **UNS Registry Contract Address**, each with its own production registry address on mainnet. The following addresses should be used as the default for production configuration:

- CNS production registry address on the mainnet: [0xD1E5b0FF1287aA9f9A268759062E4Ab08b9Dacbe](https://etherscan.io/address/0xD1E5b0FF1287aA9f9A268759062E4Ab08b9Dacbe)
- UNS production registry address on the mainnet: [0x049aba7510f45BA5b64ea9E658E342F904DB358D](https://etherscan.io/address/0x049aba7510f45BA5b64ea9E658E342F904DB358D)
