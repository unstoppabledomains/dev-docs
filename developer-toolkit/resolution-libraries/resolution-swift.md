# Resolution-Swift

This page details basic configuration and usage of the [resolution-swift library](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-swift).

## Configuration

Resolution libraries require a connection to the Ethereum network to resolve .crypto and .eth domains. To initialize the library, you need to specify an Ethereum node service provider. Once the instance is created you can begin resolving domains. Below are examples of how to initialize the library with different providers.

### Provider URL

Each of the resolution libraries supports an Ethereum provider url for configuration. You can obtain a provider url from a service like Alchemy where obtaining an API key is free and only requires creating an account.

To choose an alternative Ethereum provider see [Nodes as a Service guide.](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/)

```swift
import UnstoppableDomainsResolution

let infuraApiKey = INFURA_PROJECT_ID

guard let resolution = try? Resolution(
    configs: Configurations(
        uns: UnsLocations(
            layer1: NamingServiceConfig(
                        providerUrl: "https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/" + infuraApiKey,
                        network: "mainnet"),
            layer2: NamingServiceConfig(
                        providerUrl: "https://polygon-mainnet.infura.io/v3/" + infuraApiKey,
                        network: "polygon-mainnet")
        )
    )
) else {
  print ("Init of Resolution instance with custom parameters failed...")
  return
}
```

## Error Handling

<embed src="/snippets/_res-lib-error-intro.md" />

```swift Swift
import UnstoppableDomainsResolution

guard let resolution = try? Resolution() else {
  print ("Init of Resolution instance with default parameters failed...")
  return
}

resolution.addr(domain: "domain-with-error.crypto", ticker: "ETH") { result in
    switch result {
        case .success(let returnValue):
            // Success flow
        case .failure(let error):
            switch error {
                case ResolutionError.unregisteredDomain:
                    // Domain is not registered
                    break;

                case ResolutionError.recordNotFound:
                    // Crypto record is not found (or empty)
                    break;

                case ResolutionError.unspecifiedResolver:
                    // Domain is not configured (empty resolver)
                    break;

                case ResolutionError.unsupportedDomain:
                    // Domain is not supported
                    break;
            }
    }
}
```

| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| contractNotInitialized       | Thrown when the proxy reader of the current resolution instance has not been initialized.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| inconsistentDomainArray      | Thrown when you attempt to retrieve the locations of multiple domains with different naming services. The location of a domain contains the `blockchain`, `networkId`, and valuable metadata like `owner`, `resolver`, `registry addresses`, and `provider URL` of that domain. |
| invalidDomainName            | Thrown when you resolve an invalid domain address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| methodNotSupported           | Thrown when you use a method of the current resolution instance not supported by the naming service you're resolving from. For example, using the `batchOwners()`, `getTokenUri()`, `locations()`, and `getDomainName()` methods for the Zilliqa Name Service (ZNS).            |
| proxyReaderNonInitialized    | Thrown when the registry address of the current resolution instance has not been initialized.                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| recordNotFound               | Thrown when you resolve an undefined record of a domain. For example, resolving the Twitter handle of a domain that doesn't have one.                                                                                                                                           |
| recordNotSupported           | Thrown when you resolve an unsupported domain record.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| registryAddressIsNotProvided | Thrown when using an incorrect contract address with the current resolution instance.                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| unregisteredDomain           | Thrown when you resolve a domain not owned by any address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| unknownError                 | Thrown when an unknown error occurs while resolving a domain with the current resolution instance.                                                                                                                                                                              |
| unspecifiedResolver          | Thrown when the domain resolver contract address is not found. For example, the domain doesn't have a specified resolver.                                                                                                                                                       |
| unsupportedDomain            | Thrown when you resolve a domain with an ending not supported by the current resolution instance.                                                                                                                                                                               |
| unsupportedServiceName       | Thrown when using an unsupported naming service with the current resolution instance.                                                                                                                                                                                           |

## Use Case: Retrieve a Domain Record

Retrieve any record of a domain. Applications sometimes set custom records for a domain to use within their application. The code snippets below show how to do this for Java, JavaScript, Swift, and Golang.

```swift
// Lookup specific records
resolution.record(domain: "ryan.crypto", record: "custom.record.value") { result in
  switch result {
  case .success(let returnValue):
    // Example custom record value
    let recordValue = returnValue
  case .failure(let error):
    print("Expected record value, but got \(error)")
}
}
```
