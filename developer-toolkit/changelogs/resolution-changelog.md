# Resolution Changelog

## 9.0.0
- Initialize UNS resolution with Unstoppable Domains' partner key
- Deprecate default Infura Rpc URL

## 8.3.2

- Fixed reverse function padding issue

## 8.3.1

- Fixed tokenURI error handling

## 8.2.0

- Fixed default library configuration
- Added function for alchemy configuration `Resolution#alchemy`

## 8.0.0

- Added Node.js v16 support
- .zil domains are now also looked up via UNS
- The `locations` method was implemented for ZNS

### Breaking changes

- Dropped Node.js v10 support
- The `serviceName` method was removed
- The following methods got a new mandatory argument to specify NamingService:

  - `namehash`
  - `isValidHash`

  Note: if you used them for .zil domains, you should now determine where a
  domain is located first, It's possible that a domain has been migrated from
  ZNS to UNS, which would imply the usage of a different namehashing algorithm
  to calculate its token id.

## 7.2.0

- Implementation of reverse resolution methods

## 7.1.3

- Implemented function getDomainFromTokenId in UdApi

## 7.1.2

- Removed unused code which caused build issues on some environments

## 7.1.0

- Throw `ResolutionErrorCode.InvalidDomainAddress` error if domain contains
  special characters
  - Domain name is being validated according to the following regular
    expression: `^[.a-z0-9-]+$`

## 7.0.0

- ENS support is completely removed
- Removes `bip44-constants`, `@ensdomains/address-encoder`, and `content-hash`
  package dependencies
- Methods that query ENS domains (.eth, .luxe, .xyz, .kred, .reverse) throw
  UnsupportedDomain

## 6.0.3

- Remove relative imports to avoid issues in bundlers. Restrict relative imports
  by adding eslint rule.

## 6.0.2

- `Resolution#owner` method doesn't throw an error in case of empty resolver

## 6.0.1

- Set correct polygon-mainnet provider if use default settings

## 6.0.0

### Breaking changes

- CLI tool was removed. Please use new binary CLI tool instead:
  [Github repo](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-cli/releases).
- Constructor has changed. If you used `uns` configuration you have to specify
  parameters for L1 and L2 locations (Ethereum and Polygon mainnets).
- ENS support is deprecated and will be removed in future.
- Factory methods has changed. All of them requires provide L1 and L2 locations
  configuration for UNS. For example: `uns: {locations: {L1: ..., L2...}}`.
  - The list of affected methods:
    - `Resolution#infura`
    - `Resolution#fromResolutionProvider`
    - `Resolution#fromEthereumEip1193Provider`
    - `Resolution#fromWeb3Version0Provider`
    - `Resolution#fromWeb3Version1Provider`
    - `Resolution#fromEthersProvider`
- `Resolution#location` method is replaced by `Resolution#locations`.

### New methods and features

- ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ ðŸŽ‰ Add Polygon Layer 2 support!
- Add `Resolution#locations` method which will help to determine domains
  location (blockhain, networkId) and useful metadata like owner, resolver,
  registry addresses, provider url if possible.
  - Method returns:
    - Domain blockhain (ETH or MATIC)
    - Blockchain network id (numeric)
    - Owner address
    - Resolver address
    - Registry address
    - Provider URL if possible
      - Infura URL by default

## 5.0.2

- Replaces `node-fetch` with `cross-fetch` package

## 5.0.1

- Add `elliptic` package dependency in order to enable twitter verification
  support by default

## 5.0.0

### Breaking changes

- Constructor has changed. If you used cns configurations rename "cns" it to
  "uns" instead.
  - For example: `new Resolution({sourceConfig: {uns: {...uns config}}})`
- Method `Resolution#fromEip1193Provider` was renamed to
  `Resolution#fromEthereumEip1193Provider`
- Factory methods has changed. All of them requires `{uns: {... uns config}}` in
  parameters instead of `cns`.
  - The list of affected factory methods:
    - `Resolution#autoNetwork`
    - `Resolution#infura`
    - `Resolution#fromEthereumEip1193Provider` (former
      `Resolution#fromEip1193Provider`)

  still available under the alias `Eip1993Factories`
- Introduced new method
  `Resolution#registryAddress -> Retrieves address of registry contract used for domain`
- Introduced new method
  `Resolution#unhash -> Retrieves the domain name from tokenId by parsing registry smart contract event logs`

- Introduced new method
  `Resolution#tokenURIMetadata -> etrieves the data from the endpoint provided by tokenURI from the registry smart contract`
- Introduced new factory method
  `Resolution#fromZilliqaProvider -> Creates a resolution instance with configured provider from Zilliqa provider`
- Introduced new factory method
  `Resolution#fromResolutionProvider -> Creates a resolution from Resolution compatitable provider`
- Introduced new factory method
  `Resolution#fromEthereumEip1193Provider -> Creates a resolution from EIP-1193 compatitable provider`
- Return ENS support
- Add custom network support for ENS
