* Library builder methods regarding ens has been removed: `ensChainId`, `ensProviderUrl` and `ensContractAddress`
## 4.1.0

  * Method returns:
    * Domain blockhain (ETH or MATIC)
    * Blockchain network id (numeric)
    * Owner address
    * Resolver address
    * Registry address
    * Provider URL if possible
      * Infura URL by default

* `Resolution#isSupported` is now making an async call and throws `NamingServiceException`
* `NamingServiceType.CNS` was replaced by `NamingServiceType.UNS`.

* Remove deprecated Resolution#getUsdt, use Resolution#getMultiChainAddress() instead
* Remove deprecated Resolution#addr, use Resolution#getAddress() instead

* Remove deprecated Resolution#email, use Resolution#getEmail() instead
