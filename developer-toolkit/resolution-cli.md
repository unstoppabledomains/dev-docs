# Resolution CLI

The Resolution-CLI is built and maintained by Unstoppable Domains. It is a simple CLI tool for resolving Unstoppable domains and interacting with NFT domain names. It can be used to retrieve [payment addresses](../crypto-payments/index.md), IPFS hashes for [decentralized websites](../d-websites/index.md), DNS records and other [records types](../getting-started/domain-registry-essentials/records-reference.md). Each Resolution Library is built and maintained by Unstoppable Domains, so updates happen automatically.

For more information on resolving domains using the Resolution CLI option, please see the [Resolution CLI Repository](https://github.com/unstoppabledomains/resolution-cli) on Github.

## Use Case: Retrieve an ETH Address

This will retrieve the ETH address of a domain:

```shell
resolution resolve addr ETH -d brad.crypto
"0x8aaD44321A86b170879d7A244c1e8d360c99DdA8"
```

The crypto.ETH.address can be located in the [Records Reference](../getting-started/domain-registry-essentials/records-reference.md).

## Use Case: Retrieve a Domain Record

And this will retrieve any record from the domain, if it exists, and return the following records:

```shell
resolution resolve records crypto.ETH.address crypto.BTC.address -d brad.crypto
{
   "records": {
      "crypto.BTC.address": "bc1q359khn0phg58xgezyqsuuaha28zkwx047c0c3y",
      "crypto.ETH.address": "0x8aaD44321A86b170879d7A244c1e8d360c99DdA8"
   }
}
```
