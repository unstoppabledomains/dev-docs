# Developer Toolkit

You've reached the developer toolkit. Here's how to get started...

## Resolution API

For our Alchemy-hosted web API, see [Resolution Service API](resolution-service-api.md).

## Resolution Libraries

For language-specific, blockchain-agnostic libraries for resolving Unstoppable NFT domains (including domains on Ethereum, Polygon, and Zilliqa) see our [Resolution Libraries](resolution-libraries/libraries-overview.md). These are managed by Unstoppable and updated regularly to reflect changes in our services.

## Resolution CLI

For an Unstoppable-managed, blockchain-agnostic command-line interface for resolving all Unstoppable NFT domains, see [Resolution CLI](resolution-cli.md).

## Resolve via Direct Blockchain Calls

For developers who want more direct, low level control over domain resolution, see [Resolve with Direct Blockchain Calls](./direct-blockchain-calls/bc-overview.md). This will require updates to any integration to reflect future changes in Unstoppable resolution services, such as new domain endings.
