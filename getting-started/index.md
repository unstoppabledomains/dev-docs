# UD Dev Portal Overview

This developer portal is designed to help you understand how to build and integrate custom applications using Unstoppable Domains products.
It's a great companion to our [Feature Guide Collection](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLkKiQerk3s0AbMvBafwmJdR8pv7qPYeL-) on Youtube.

Also, you might explore our growing list of [Integrated Applications](https://unstoppabledomains.com/apps) to draw inspiration for your own project.

## Before You Begin

You'll need the following to get started:
- Basic understanding of [CNS](../developer-toolkit/smart-contracts/cns-smart-contracts.md) and [UNS](../developer-toolkit/smart-contracts/uns-smart-contracts.md) Smart Contracts
- Knowledge of differences between [L1 and L2 network](../polygon/index.md)
- A [free test domain](./test-domains/etherscan.md)
- A stable test environment

## How This Portal Is Organized

These items are listed in order of complexity. For example, if you are just starting out with crypto and blockchains, you may want to begin with the use cases and the menu items on your left. More advanced members may decide to jump right to the integration guides, API reference, or developer toolkit.
