The [Partner API](/domain-distribution-and-management/overview.md) only supports Polygon Layer2 Network. And, for [Unstoppable Login](/identity/quickstart/retrieve-client-credentials.md), it can be integrated with any EVM-compatible DApp. However, domains minted on testnets (e.g. Mumbai or Goerli) are not supported.

## Step 1: Gather Requirements for the Website Faucet

- A Web3 compatible wallet
- Configure your wallet for the [Polygon/Mumbai](/manage-domains/guides/add-polygon-to-metamask.md) network

- Ensure you have funds in your wallet to pay transaction fees

Domains on Polygon mainnet can be purchased for free through Unstoppable Website Faucet, but members will need to cover their own gas fees to mint the domain.
