# High Level Overview

Unstoppable Domains uses Polygon as our layer 2 (L2) scaling solution. This allows us to make our NFT domains free to claim and manage on L2, and UD customers will no longer have to pay claim fees, renewal fees, or gas fees. As part of this integration, new and existing users will be able to mint and manage their unclaimed domains for free on Polygon and existing users will be able to move their claimed domains from Zilliqa and Ethereum to Polygon as well if they so choose.

Polygon POS Chain is the leading platform for Ethereum scaling and infrastructure development. Its growing suite of products offers developers easy access to all major scaling and infrastructure solutions: L2 solutions (ZK Rollups and Optimistic Rollups), sidechains, commit chains, hybrid solutions, stand-alone and enterprise chains, data availability solutions, and more.&#x20;

## Benefits

By removing the transactional costs involved in hosting and managing NFT domains, a whole new set of capabilities becomes viable for everyday use.&#x20;

* Customers will be able to connect multiple wallets to their domains for payment, host, and edit decentralized websites (blogs, NFT galleries, etc) without having to worry about paying gas fees.&#x20;
* Developers will be able to design and create new templates, with increased complexity and functionality without the concern that users might not be able to afford to use them.&#x20;
* NFT domains will become a viable alternative to existing web2 single sign-on such as with our newly announced product, [Login with Unstoppable](broken-reference).&#x20;

## Considerations

* All new domains will be minted on L2; all L1 minting is disabled.
* Domains claimed on Polygon may not resolve in all wallets and exchanges until resolution updates have been made to integrated apps.&#x20;
* We cannot guarantee a specific timeline for each app as it's at the discretion of each individual product and engineering organization.&#x20;
* The initial L2 release won’t support domain transferring, from L1 to L2; this support is planned for a future release.&#x20;

## Future Releases

The table below identifies the initial L2 features as well as planned future releases.
