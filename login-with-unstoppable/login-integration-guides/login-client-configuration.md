# Login Client Configuration

This page explains the settings currently available for configuring a Login with Unstoppable client on the [Client Management Dashboard](https://dashboard.auth.unstoppabledomains.com). The default configuration for a new client works right out of the box for local development. The minimum viable configuration for the Login with Unstoppable client integrated with a live application requires custom [**redirect URIs**](#redirect-uris).

:::warning
You must **Confirm Changes** made to your client configuration before they will take effect. For enhanced security, certain actions may require a wallet signature. This does not require any ETH in your wallet. You will only need to sign transactions to confirm ownership of your wallet address.
:::

## Branding

The **Branding Configuration** page allows developers to customize the Login With Unstoppable UI to more closely match their own application's user experience.

The following table describes the fields for the cosmetic configuration UI section.

| Field | Description                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Client Name           | The client name as presented to the user; display name of the **Client URI** hyperlink.                                     |
| Client URI            | The default value of the hyperlink is the client redirect URI (from **Client Metadata**) unless this field is complete.     |
| Logo URI              | If provided, the client will retrieve and display an image from this location directly above the **Client Name**.           |
| Policy URI            | Policy URI will display at the bottom of the UI.                                                                            |
| Terms of Service URI  | Terms of Service URI will display at the bottom of the UI.                                                                  |

## Login

The **Login** configuration page contains settings and metadata specific to Login with Unstoppable integrations.

### Client Metadata

The Client Metadata contains the client-specific information required to send requests to the Unstoppable authorization server. It is updated to reflect confirmed changes to client settings.

```javascript
{
    clientID: "xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
    clientSecret: "xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx",
    clientAuthMethod: "client_secret_xxxx",
    redirectUri: "http://localhost/",
    scope: "openid wallet",
}
```

| Field                 | Description |
| --------------------- | ----------- |
| `clientID`            | Your unique Client ID generated by the Client Management Dashboard. |
| `clientSecret`        | A private key known only to your application and the authorization server. Present only if [Token Endpoint Authentication Method](#token-endpoint-authentication-method) is enabled. |
| `clientAuthMethod`    | Reflects the value of [Token Endpoint Authentication Method](#token-endpoint-authentication-method), if it is enabled. |
| `scope`              | The profile information your application will be requesting from the user. In addition to the minimum scope of `openid wallet`, applications can request additional [scopes](/login-with-unstoppable/scopes-for-login.md) by adding more tokens to this string in their UAuth configuration options. |
| `redirectURI`         | The URI that the auth server will redirect to after every authorization attempt. |

### Redirect URIs

Add new **Redirect URIs** to your client by entering them into the text input box at the end of the list and hitting `return`/`enter` or clicking the `+` button to the right.

<figure>

![Entering Redirect URIs](/images/login-enter-redirect-uris.gif '#width=70%')

<figcaption>Add new Redirect URIs</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Rules for Redirect URIs

The Redirect URIs follow three rules:

1. `http` URIs must resolve to URIs hosted at `http://127.0.0.1` or `http://localhost`.
2. URIs hosted at `http://127.0.0.1` do **NOT** require the port to be specified. All other URIs (including those hosted at `http://localhost`) require the correct port to be specified.
3. All https URIs specified must use the same origin (e.g. `https://unstoppabledomains.com/redirectUri1`, `https://unstoppabledomains.com/redirectUri2`)

:::info
`localhost` is okay for test development, but `127.0.0.1` should be used for live environments. It is best practice to use a hardcoded IP address in a live environment instead of the local host.
:::

## TLDs

The **TLDs Configuration** page allows Login partners to select which TLDs (also known as domain endings or domain extensions) will be availabe to users as part of this Login client's free and paid domain flows.

View the full list of supported TLDs by clicking the **Manage TLD** button.

## Payment

The **Payment** page allows Login partners to enable revenue share and receive a percentage of paid domains sold in the integrated login flow. This requires no additional code from existing login integrations. To enable this feature:

1. Enable **Receive revenue from selling domains**

<figure>

![Enable Receive revenue from selling domains](/images/login-client-enable-rev-share.png '#width=65%')

<figcaption>Enable <strong>Receive revenue from selling domains</strong></figcaption>
</figure>

2. Enter your [Reseller ID](/partner/partner-integration-guides/mint-free-domains/#step-1-retrieve-your-reseller-id-and-secret-api-token). If you don't have one, you will need to [create a new UD Partner account](/partner/).

<figure>

![Enter your Reseller ID](/images/login-client-reseller-id-entered.png '#width=65%')

<figcaption>Enter your Reseller ID</figcaption>

3. Enter your email and send a revenue share request.

<figure>

![Send revenue share request](/images/login-client-send-rev-share-request.png '#width=65%')

## Badges

The **Badges** configuration page allows partners to submit custom badges that can be earned and displayed on users' Unstoppable Domains profile pages. For an example of a ud.me profile with multiple badges earned see [ud.me/sandy.nft](https://ud.me/sandy.nft).

<figure>

![Badges page with an existing badge](../../static/images/login-client-config-badges-list.png '#width=65%;')


<figcaption>Badges configuration page with a pending badge</figcaption>

## Advanced Configuration

The **Advanced Configuration** page includes options for CORS, audience URIs, grant types, response types, scopes, and token endpoint auth method.

:::danger
The advanced configuration settings are unnecessary for many configurations and could break existing Login integrations.
:::

<figure>

![Login Client Advanced Configuration](/images/login-client-advanced-config.png '#width=50%')

<figcaption>Advanced</figcaption>
</figure>

The following section describes the fields for the **Advanced** configuration page.

### Allowed CORS Origins

CORS is a browser protocol for accessing info from another domain. If a URI is entered, CORS is enabled for all requests from that client. Developers can enter the origin URI and specify the port. The Token, UserInfo, and Revocation endpoints all respect this option.

:::warning
The initial authorization endpoint that users are redirected to cannot use CORS; it will not work.
:::

### Audience URIs

:::info
This only needs to be configured if using an API that requires an audience URI.
:::

These URIs represent the audience that is inside the access token JWTs. You get back an access token and ID token and both are JWTs. The access token is opaque.

* For the ID token, the audience are the clientIDs.
* For the access token, the audience is the resource servers; those resource server URLs are the audience for the access token.

### Grant Types

There are two ways to request an access token: authorization code and refresh token.

* **auth code:** short lived, used to initially get the session with the user, corresponds to _authorization\_code grant type_
* **refresh token:** lives longer, used to maintain a session, receive an extra token to re-authenticate users later for a certain period of time, corresponds to the _offline grant type_

### Response Types

There are three response types: authorization code, access token, ID token.

* **auth code:** more secure; returns authorization code which you exchange for authorization
* **access token:** implicit flow, not recommended because it is less secure; no code but you receive ID or access token
* **ID token:** hybrid flow; receive all three: access code, access token, and/or ID token

:::danger
All authorization code requests or flows must use the PKCE extension. This only refers to the authorization code response type.
:::

### Token Endpoint Authentication Method

:::info
This setting cannot be used for front-end integrations. It can only be enabled for applications, such as servers, that can store secrets.
:::

This setting configures how to send the client secret to the authorization server after you receive the authorization code; can be enabled for an extra layer of security but can only be used if your application can store secrets (e.g., node.js integrations). The client secret is stored on the server as a hash, so the authorization server doesn't actually know the client secret. See additional resources for [Client Basic and Client Secret oAuth](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749#section-2.3.1).

* **client secret basic:** uses http basic authentication to send over clientid:clientsecret inside the header, which is base64 encoded.
* **client secret post:** uses http POST authentication to send over client\_secret parameter inside the body.

:::danger warning
**Copy** and **Save** the Client Secret as soon as the Token Authentication Method has been changed/saved because the client secret will not re-appear after the page is refreshed. If you lose the client secret after the application goes live, then the only way to change the secret is to rotate it and immediately download the client metadata, so you have a copy of the client configuration (to create a new client with new login credentials).
