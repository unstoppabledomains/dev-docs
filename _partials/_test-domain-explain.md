To make integrations easier, Unstoppable Domains provides developers with a free test domain. You can use any available domain ending for your free test domain.

To distinguish these test domains from paid domains, all test domains are prefixed with `uns-devtest-`. For example:

* `uns-devtest-freedomainisawesome.crypto`
* `uns-devtest-test-wallet-integration.wallet`

To prevent abuse, we only allow to mint one domain per account, on our website. **Unstoppable Domains does not make any money from issuing test domains.**
