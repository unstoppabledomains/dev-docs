# Login Error Codes

Login with Unstoppable uses the OAuth 2.0 framework. The error codes below are based on that framework and only include codes specific to the Login feature.

## 400 Error: Bad Request

These errors are the most common and are generally perceived as client errors (e.g., malformed syntax, invalid request parameters, etc.).

| `invalid_state`             | The state is missing or does not have enough characters and is therefore considered too weak.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
