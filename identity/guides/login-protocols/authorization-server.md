# Authorization Server

In order for an OpenID Connect Relying Party (RP) to utilize OpenID Connect services for an End-User, the RP needs to know where the OpenID Provider is. RPs can use [OpenID Connect Discovery](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html).

Specifically, the extension provides an alternative method for OpenID Connect Issuer Discovery, [Section 2](https://openid.net/specs/openid-connect-discovery-1_0.html#IssuerDiscovery). With Unstoppable Login, clients will resolve WebFinger information using records stored on a domain name instead of resolving WebFinger information from a server. Essentially, this process allows End-Users to specify their OpenID Provider using their domains.

## Unstoppable WebFinger & Issuer Discovery

Unstoppable Webfinger uses a variety of records stored on domains to resolve a WebFinger Issuer discovery request. For Unstoppable Login, webfinger information can be stored on the domain in the following ways: by request, reference, or value.

[WebFinger](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7033) requires the following information to make a discovery request:

- resource: Identifier for the target End-User that is the subject of the discovery request
- host: Server where a WebFinger service is hosted
- rel: URI that identifies the type of service whose location is being requested

Traditional Issuer discovery requires only the requestor resource and host to form the request, the rel must be [http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer](http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer) to make an issuer request.

#### Example: WebFinger Web3 Domain Records

```
{
	“webfinger”: {
	“alice”: { “https://example.com/webfinger/rel”: “{\“uri\”:\“ipfs://Qme7ss3ARVgxv6rXqVPiikMJ8u2NLgmgszg13pYrDKEoiu\”}”

“bob”: {“https://example.com/webfinger/rel”: “{\“host\”:\“example.com\”}”},
“charlie”: {“https://example.com/webfinger/rel”: “{\“value\”:\“{...Webfinger JRD Doc...}\”}”}
}
```

#### Example: WebFinger DNS Records

| Name      | Type | Value                                      |
| --------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------ |
| webfinger | TXT  | BASE64 encoded Document from above example |

### **By Request**

This is a method used to construct a WebFinger request. The below fields are used to construct a WebFinger request, that a Client can then resolve.

| Field | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| ----- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| user  | The OPTIONAL user of the account. If one was resolving this information on domain.tld, the webfinger resource constructed would be acct:user@domain.tld. If no user is present in the record, the account would be domain itself, i.e. acct:@domain.tld. |
| host  | Server where a WebFinger service is hosted.                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| rel   | The OPTIONAL URI that identifies the type of service whose location is being requested, defaults to [http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer](http://openid.net/specs/connect/1.0/issuer), used for Unstoppable Issuer Discovery.                     |

| value | The WebFinger JRD Document in plaintext.                                                                                                                       |
| rel   | The OPTIONAL URI that identifies the type of service whose location is being requested. This is interpreted in the same way as it is in the “By Request” flow. |

## Unstoppable Authentication

Unstoppable Authentication is a group of methods for authenticating End-Users of blockchain based domain names. OpenID Connect has no standards around authentication, other than metadata encoded inside jwts, e.g. _amr_, [Authentication Method Reference Values](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8176).

Unstoppable Authentication uses two types of authentication that authorization servers will need to support Logins with Unstoppable: owner-based authentication and record-based authentication.

### Owner-based authentication

This is the default authentication method used for Unstoppable Authentication. To consent, users sign a message provided by an Authentication server, instead of using a username and password combination. We use the owner of the domain as the public key that is recovered.

The Authentication server should use the AMR Value of _uns-own_.

### Record-based authentication

For domains owned by multisig wallets, owner-based authentication isn’t sufficient for authentication because there is no private key associated with the owner account. To solve this problem, domains can specify a private key as a record on the domain.

## Ethereum Address

The below fields are used to specify a public key that can be used for authentication.

| addr           | An Ethereum address corresponding to a private key a user owns.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| addr_type_hint | An OPTIONAL hint for the Authentication server to suggest sign-in methods. If no hint is present the Authentication server should display as many methods as it can support.                                                                             |

For context, _addr_type_hint_ can have the following values:

If the Ethereum account is stored using a hardware wallet, the AMR Value SHOULD be _uns-hwk_. For all other address types, the Authentication server should use the AMR Value of _uns-swk_.
:::

## **JWKS by Value**

The Authentication Server should use the AMR Value of _uns-swk_.

| Field | Description                                                                                                    |

| jwks  | A JWKS document stored in plaintext containing the signing key(s) used to prove the identity of the End-User   |

### Example: Authentication Web3 domain Records

Those records would correspond to the user alice@domain.tld.

```
{
	“authentication”: {
	“alice”: “{\“addr\”:\“0x1234567890123456789012345678901234567890\”,\“addr_type_hint\”:\“web3\”}”,

“charlie”: “{\“jwks_uri\”:\“ipfs://Qme7ss3ARVgxv6rXqVPiikMJ8u2NLgmgszg13pYrDKEoiu\”}”
}
}
```

## JWKS by Reference

The Authentication Server should use the AMR Value of _uns-swk._

| Field   | Description                                                                                                    |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| user    | The OPTIONAL user of the account. This is interpreted in the same way as it is in the "Ethereum Address" flow. |
| jwk_uri | URL of the JWKS document containing the signing key(s) used to prove the identity of the End-User              |

## Introspective Access Token Validation

Access tokens are put into an authorization header using the “Bearer” authentication scheme with the following format:

```
Authentication: "Bearer " + Base64<username + ":" + token_id>

username = The subject of the access_token
token_id = The token returned from the token_endpoint earlier
```

This scheme is very similar to the Basic Authentication scheme, but for compatibility purposes, the token is opaque and therefore a Bearer token.
