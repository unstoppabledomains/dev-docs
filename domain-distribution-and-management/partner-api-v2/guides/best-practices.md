# Best Practices for Integrating Partner API v2 (Legacy)

:::warning Partner API v2 Deprecation
Partner API v2 will be deprecated on Feb 12, 2024. Please check the [v3 specification](https://docs.unstoppabledomains.com/openapi/partner/latest/) for integration guides.
:::

Here are best practices to ensure the proper integration of the Unstoppable Domains Partner API v2 (Legacy) into your applications:

## Simplify Your Domain Search Fields With the Domains Suggestions Endpoint

Instead of making API calls to both the [Domain Name Availability](./check-domains-availability.md) and [Get Domains Suggestions](../quickstart/search-domains.md) endpoints to check the availability of a domain name and generate domain suggestions for a domain search field, you can make a single request to the `Get Domains Suggestions` endpoint with the requested domain name as a `search` parameter. If the domain name is available, it will be at the top of the list, along with other suggestions.

## Utilize Free Domains as an Incentive To Complete KYC

Since distributing Free Domains **requires** strict anti-abuse measures, such as KYC, we recommend claiming a free domain as an incentive to complete KYC within your application.

## Only Pre-fill Crypto Records if Your App Is a Wallet

Unstoppable Domains Partner API v2 (Legacy) can pre-fill crypto payment addresses for the user during the minting process, which adds complexity to the implementation. Therefore, we only recommend doing this if your application is a wallet since wallets contain the addresses of various cryptos for the user.

## Donâ€™t Use Your Secrets in the Frontend

Using your Partner API v2 (Legacy) key from the backend of your application is recommended rather than the frontend. If the API key is placed in the frontend, it becomes accessible by anyone who has access to the client-side code, increasing the risk of unauthorized access or misuse. To protect against this, use the API key from the backend to keep it secure.
