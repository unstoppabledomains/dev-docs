[**InterPlanetary File System** \(IPFS\)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/InterPlanetary_File_System) is a protocol and peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. This protocol is similar to BitTorrent in that IPFS allows users to receive and host content inside the peer-to-peer network.

As opposed to a centrally located server, IPFS is built around a decentralized system of user-operators who hold a portion of the overall data, creating a resilient system of file storage and sharing.
