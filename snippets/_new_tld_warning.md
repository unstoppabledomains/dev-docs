Unstoppable Domains periodically adds new domain endings, and our Resolution libraries and APIs are designed to detect and support them automatically. This means you do not need to implement a front-end filter in your application (e.g., by hard-coding specific domains or using a regex filter for only `.crypto`, `.nft`, etc.). We also provide an [API endpoint to query for supported domain endings](/openapi/resolution/#operation/StatusController.listSupportedTlds).
