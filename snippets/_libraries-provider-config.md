## Configuration

The Resolution libraries require a connection to the Ethereum network to resolve domains (`.crypto`, `.nft`, etc.). To use these libraries, you must specify an Ethereum node service provider. Once you have created an instance of the library, you can begin resolving domains. Examples of how to initialize the library with different providers are provided below.

### Provider URL

Each of the Resolution Libraries supports using an Ethereum provider URL for configuration. You can obtain this URL from a service like Alchemy, which offers a free API key to users who create an account. If you wish to use an alternative Ethereum provider, see the [Nodes as a Service](https://ethereum.org/en/developers/docs/nodes-and-clients/nodes-as-a-service/) guide for more information.
