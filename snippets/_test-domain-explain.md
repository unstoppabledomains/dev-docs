To make integrations easier, Unstoppable Domains provides developers with a free test domain. You can use any available domain ending for your free test domain (except .zil).

To distinguish these test domains from paid domains, all test domains are prefixed with `udtestdev-`. For example:

* `udtestdev-freedomainisawesome.crypto`
* `udtestdev-test-wallet-integration.wallet`

To prevent abuse, we ask that developers cover the cost of minting and transferring these domains to their wallets. **Unstoppable Domains does not make any money from issuing test domains.**
