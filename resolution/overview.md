# Unstoppable Resolution Overview

Domain Resolution is the process of converting a human-readable domain name to the cryptocurrency addresses attached to it. Unstoppable Resolution is a feature that simplifies this process and enables applications that integrate to return a wallet address for any of our over [310 supported cryptocurrencies](https://unstoppabledomains.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48001185621-supported-cryptocurrencies) from a single domain name.

Check out the video below for a high-level overview!
