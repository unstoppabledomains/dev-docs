# Unstoppable Resolution Overview

Domain Resolution is the process of converting a human-readable domain name to the cryptocurrency addresses attached to it. Unstoppable Resolution is a feature that simplifies this process and enables applications that integrate to return a wallet address for any of our over [310 supported cryptocurrencies](https://unstoppabledomains.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/48001185621-supported-cryptocurrencies) from a single domain name.

Check out the video below for a high-level overview!

## Resolution Service API

For our HTTP-based API that allows you to quickly build applications that fetch UD domain data from the blockchain with a single API request, see the [Resolution Service API](/openapi/resolution). The Unstoppable Domains team manages this service.

## Resolution Libraries

For language-specific, blockchain-agnostic libraries for resolving Unstoppable Web3 domains (including domains on Ethereum, Polygon, and Zilliqa) see our [Resolution Libraries](sdks-and-libraries/javascript.md) guide. These are managed by Unstoppable and updated regularly to reflect changes in our services.

## Resolution CLI

For an Unstoppable-managed, blockchain-agnostic command-line interface for resolving all Unstoppable Web3 domains, see the [Resolution CLI](sdks-and-libraries/cli.md) guide.

## Resolve Using Matic.js SDK

For developers developing on Polygon using the [Matic.js SDK](https://github.com/maticnetwork/matic.js) and who want an easy way to integrate domain resolution functionalities into their applications, see the [Resolve Using Matic.js SDK](sdks-and-libraries/maticjs.md) guide.
