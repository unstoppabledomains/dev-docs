# Resolution Libraries

Resolution libraries are used for interacting with Web3 domain names. They can be used to retrieve crypto addresses, IPFS hashes for decentralized websites, DNS records and other [records types](/resolution/records-reference.md). Each Resolution Library is built and maintained by Unstoppable Domains, so updates happen automatically.
