# Resolution Libraries

Resolution libraries are used for interacting with Web3 domain names. They can be used to retrieve [payment addresses](/crypto-payments/index.md), IPFS hashes for [decentralized websites](/d-websites/index.md), DNS records and other [records types](/resolution/guides/records-reference.md). Each Resolution Library is built and maintained by Unstoppable Domains, so updates happen automatically.
